Setup
=====

Download the "All Metabolites" file from HMDB at http://www.hmdb.ca/downloads .
Unzip it into the `input` directory to obtain `hmdb_metabolites.xml` (1.6GB).


Usage
=====

python map_metabolites.py input.csv > output.csv


Notes
=====

This script takes over 4GB of RAM to parse the XML file, even with aggressive
freeing of unused lxml tree elements. This needs to be addressed.
